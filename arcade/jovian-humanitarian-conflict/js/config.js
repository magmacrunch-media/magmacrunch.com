// Per-frame convention, inherited from Roderick Tron: every rate below is
// expressed in "units per 60fps frame" and multiplied by dt at the point of
// use, so the game runs identically on a 60Hz and a 144Hz display. Anything
// measured in frames (a cooldown, a telegraph window) is likewise a count of
// 60fps frames and is decremented by dt, not by 1.

    // ── The rail ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    //
    // World space is (x, y, z): x right, y down, z into the screen. z = 0 is
    // the plane the player's ship sits on; contacts spawn at Z_FAR and travel
    // toward the camera. Screen scale is FOCAL / (z + FOCAL), so it is exactly
    // 1.0 at z = 0 and falls off hyperbolically — the same divide a real
    // perspective transform does, which is why distant things bunch up near
    // the horizon the way they should.
    // FOCAL is the one number that decides whether this game is legible.
    //
    // It was 220 to begin with, which is the dramatic choice: scale runs 1.0 to
    // 0.167 across the rail, so contacts rush at you six-fold. Measured against
    // the real projection, that put every contact in a SIXTEEN pixel band at
    // the horizon at three to eight pixels wide, sitting on the bright edge of
    // the cloud deck. The whole 480x270 frame was going unused and the sprites
    // were too small to read — fatal in a game whose only question is what you
    // are looking at.
    //
    // 520 trades some of that rush for a frame you can actually play in:
    //
    //     z=0    1.00        z=600 (firing range)  0.46
    //     z=410  0.56        z=1100 (spawn)        0.32
    //
    // Still a three-fold approach, but a hostile is 7px at spawn and 10px by
    // the time it can be shot, and contacts fan out across the width and height
    // of the frame instead of bunching on one line.
