// Procedural sound effects, synthesised rather than shipped.
//
// No .ogg files: every sound here is a few oscillators and a noise burst, the
// way arcade/very-long-boards does it. That keeps the game to one audio asset
// (the track itself, already 2.7MB) and lets the sounds be tuned by editing
// numbers instead of re-exporting samples.
//
// AdAudio is deliberately not used for these. It loads SFX from URLs into
// buffers, which is the right shape for recorded samples and the wrong one for
// six sounds that are cheaper to generate than to fetch. AdAudio still owns the
// music, and this module owns everything else.
//
// ── The ping is not decoration ──
//
// `ping()` is the transponder heard rather than seen: it fires once per aid
// convoy, at Z_PING, which is well outside firing range. It exists so that a
// player who misses the visual blink still gets told a convoy is inbound, and
// it deliberately copies the rhythm of that blink — two quick notes at the same
// spacing — so the eye and the ear are reporting the same thing rather than two
// unrelated signals. Everything else in here can be muted without changing what
// the game asks of you. This one cannot, which is why it is the loudest of the
// quiet sounds.
