# George Boole has entered the chat 🎮

A **Boolean logic puzzle game** where you combine numbers using bitwise operations and survive as long as possible! Think survival mode meets computer science - use logic gates (XOR, OR, AND, NOT) to manage your board before it fills up!

---

## 🎯 How to Play

### Goal
**Survive as long as possible** and earn the highest score by strategically using logic gates and managing your board space!

### The Twist: Boolean Logic!
Unlike 2048 where tiles double (2+2=4), this game uses **Boolean operations**:

#### Same Numbers Consolidate
```
1 + 1 = 1  (idempotence: A∨A = A)
2 + 2 = 2  (same values merge to same)
3 + 3 = 3  (no doubling!)
```

#### Different Numbers Need Gates
You **cannot** merge different numbers directly! You must use logic gates:
```
Can't do: 1 + 2
Must use: 1 [OR] 2 = 3
       or 1 [XOR] 2 = 3
```

#### Logic Gate Operations
- **XOR (⊕)**: `1 XOR 2 = 3`, `2 XOR 3 = 1`
- **OR (∨)**: `1 OR 2 = 3`, `4 OR 3 = 7`
- **AND (∧)**: `3 AND 2 = 2`, `7 AND 4 = 4`
- **NOT (¬)**: `NOT 1 = 2` (in 2-bit), `NOT 8 = 7` (in 4-bit)
  - **Special:** NOT is unary - just slide it into any number! No sandwich needed.

## 🔄 Rollover Mechanic

Each bit mode has a **maximum value** (2ⁿ - 1):

| Mode | Max Value | What Happens |
|------|-----------|--------------|
| 2-BIT | 3 | Operations exceeding 3 → **OVERFLOW! +9 bonus pts** |
| 3-BIT | 7 | Operations exceeding 7 → **OVERFLOW! +21 bonus pts** |
| 4-BIT | 15 | Operations exceeding 15 → **OVERFLOW! +45 bonus pts** |
| 5-BIT | 31 | Operations exceeding 31 → **OVERFLOW! +93 bonus pts** |
| 6-BIT | 63 | Operations exceeding 63 → **OVERFLOW! +189 bonus pts** |
| 7-BIT | 127 | Operations exceeding 127 → **OVERFLOW! +381 bonus pts** |
| 8-BIT | 255 | Operations exceeding 255 → **OVERFLOW! +765 bonus pts** |
| GAUNTLET | ∞ | Progressive — survive all modes! |

**Strategic choice:** Overflow clears the tile (frees space) AND awards big bonus points!

## 🎮 Game Modes

Modes are named after real bit-culture terminology:

| Mode | Name | Max Value | Theme |
|------|------|-----------|-------|
| 2-BIT | crumb | 3 | Game Boy green |
| 3-BIT | trit | 7 | NES red/orange |
| 4-BIT | nibble | 15 | SNES blue/purple |
| 5-BIT | pentad | 31 | Genesis blue/cyan |
| 6-BIT | hexad | 63 | Arcade red/gold |
| 7-BIT | ascii | 127 | Neo Geo pink/cyan |
| 8-BIT | byte | 255 | PS1 silver (gold accents) |
| GAUNTLET | progressive | — | Matrix green |

### 🔄 Gauntlet Mode: Progressive Difficulty
Gauntlet mode is the **ultimate survival challenge** with escalating difficulty:

- **Start at 2-BIT** (max value: 3)
- **Reach the max value** → Automatic upgrade!
- **Progress through all modes**: 2-BIT → 3-BIT → 4-BIT → 5-BIT → 6-BIT → 7-BIT → 8-BIT
- **Each upgrade** increases max value and difficulty
- **Watch the display**: Shows current mode and goal (e.g., "REACH → 3")
- **Final challenge**: Survive 8-BIT mode as long as you can!

**Example:** Start with max value 3, reach it, upgrade to max value 7, reach it, upgrade to max value 15, and so on...

## 📊 Scoring System

### How Points are Earned:

1. **Operations**: Points = result value
   - `1 + 1 = 1` → +1 point
   - `4 OR 3 = 7` → +7 points

2. **Height Bonuses**: First time reaching certain values (must be earned through merges, not spawned)
   - 3-bit: Bonuses for 6, 7 (double value!)
   - 4-bit: Bonuses for 5+
   - Higher modes: Upper-tier values only

3. **Overflow Bonuses**: Max value × 3
   - 2-bit overflow: +9 points
   - 8-bit overflow: +765 points!

**Strategy:** Balance survival (consolidate) vs. scoring (reach new heights, cause overflows)

### 🏅 Special Tile Treatments

- **Rainbow tile**: The exact max-value tile in each mode gets a rainbow gradient. In Gauntlet, the specific tile instance that *earned* the mode upgrade is marked — it travels with you as you play.
- **Gold-plated tile**: The single tile representing your current session high gets a shimmering gold treatment. Only awarded for values you *earned through merges* (not randomly spawned ones), and only for meaningful achievements above each mode's threshold.

## 🎯 Strategy Tips

### Beginners:
- Learn what each gate does (check instructions!)
- NOT gates are easy - just slide them into any number!
- Consolidate same numbers to free space
- Don't be afraid of overflow - it gives bonus points!

### Intermediate:
- Plan gate usage 2-3 moves ahead
- Balance scoring (new highs) vs. survival (consolidation)
- Use overflow strategically to clear space

### Advanced:
- Maximize height bonuses in mid-game
- Time overflows for maximum points
- Manage board space like Tetris

## ⚡ Performance Optimizations

### Automatic Optimizations:
- Background animations only run during active gameplay
- Loading spinner stops when hidden
- Audio fades use fewer steps (still smooth!)
- Reduced GPU memory usage

### Performance Mode:
Toggle in Settings → Display Options to:
- Disable CRT scanline effects
- Disable background glow animations
- Reduce CPU usage by 70-85%
- Keep gameplay completely intact

**Perfect for:** Laptops, extended sessions, battery saving, or if your device runs hot!

## 🗺️ Planned Features

### 16-BIT Mode (word)
The next planned mode after 8-BIT would be **16-BIT**, named "word" — the actual technical term used in assembly and low-level programming (alongside dword for 32-bit and qword for 64-bit).

Key design considerations for 16-BIT:
- **Max value**: 65,535 — far too large to read comfortably in decimal
- **Hexadecimal display**: tiles would show values in hex notation (e.g. `0xFF`, `0x3F`) instead of decimal, since hex maps naturally onto bit boundaries and is how programmers actually think about 16-bit values
- **Gameplay tuning**: the much larger value range would require rethinking spawn rates and overflow bonuses to keep sessions feeling meaningful
- Future modes beyond 16-bit (32-bit "dword", 64-bit "qword") would follow the same hex convention

This would also be a natural point to introduce a **hex display toggle** in Settings alongside the existing binary display toggle.

## 📝 Version History

### Latest (February 2026)
- **CSS refactor**: split `modals.css` into 5 focused files (`modal-title`, `modal-difficulty`, `modal-scoreboard`, `modal-settings`, `modal-misc`) for easier maintenance
- **Settings modal fix**: toggle buttons and HOW TO PLAY/CREDITS links now correctly use default styling regardless of active game theme (same `!important` pattern already used by the scoreboard modal)
- Added **OVERALL high scores** board: top 10 across all modes with mode badge on each entry
- **Smart scoreboard default**: shows OVERALL on first visit; remembers last-played mode across sessions
- **5-BIT theme redesign**: Genesis blue/cyan replaces blue/gold — eliminates clash with gold personal-best tile
- **8-BIT contrast fix**: tile text now uses gold on dark grey tiles, dark text on light grey tiles
- **Score entry layout**: switched to CSS grid — mode badge no longer wraps or gets squeezed
- **Top-3 rank colors**: gold/silver/bronze on #1/#2/#3 rank numbers (no redundant label text)
- **Binary display improvements**: larger text (10px→13px), higher opacity (0.7→0.85), safe smaller decimal to prevent overflow; per-theme color fixes for low-contrast tiles
- **Mode button subtitles**: larger (7px→9px), higher opacity, per-theme color overrides for legibility
- **Retro UI**: replaced all in-game emoji (medals, notifications) with ASCII alternatives (*** OVERFLOW ***, >>> NEW HIGH, etc.)
- **Score box ring fix**: cyan box-shadow no longer bleeds through on PS1, Matrix, and Genesis themes
